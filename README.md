Project: Language Identification

This project concerns itself with a Natural Language Processing ("NLP") system which is able to identify the language of a given text. It is part of the examination in the lecture on "Advanced Natural Language Processing" of the M. Sc. Cognitive Systems at the University of Potsdam.

Our team consists of Bhuvanesh Verma, Ian Clotworthy and Arthur Hilbert.

This repository includes the WiLI-2018 dataset:
