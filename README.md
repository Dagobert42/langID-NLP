Project: Language Identification for Natural Language Processing

The goal of this project is to develop a Natural Language Processing ("NLP") system which is able to identify the language of a given text. This classification task is generally referred to as language identification ("LI") and has been the subject of research from as early as 1965 according to Jauhiainen et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08186), giving us a wide variety of options to explore. it is part of the examination in the lecture on "Advanced Natural Language Processing" of the M. Sc. Cognitive Systems at the University of Potsdam. Our team consists of Bhuvanesh Verma, Ian Clotworthy and Arthur Hilbert.
